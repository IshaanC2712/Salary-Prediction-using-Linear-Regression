# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

This is a Machine Learning Project to find Salary of a person using Linear Regression Model. 



## About the Project

This analysis and prediction is based upon generating the salaries with years of experience as an input.
This is a simple model and it factors only the years of experience as the independent variable and does not consider a person's skills, or previous experience.
The Linear Regression Model is a supervised learning Statistical method used modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (also known as the outcome or target variable) and one or more independent variables (also known as predictors or features).
